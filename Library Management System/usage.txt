Here are all the functions with syntax, make sure to add this line in start "from database_handler import *"

1. add_record("Book Name", "Book Author", "Book Genre")		// To save a book info
2. show_one("Book Name", mode)								// Will return record acc to mode
3. show_all()												// Will return all record of table
4. delete_record("Book Name")								// Will delete all the records matching Book name

show_one("Book Name", mode) will return a list of found records with every element being a list containig all info for the book.
                            mode can get value 1-3:
                                1 -> acc to book name
                                2 -> acc to author name
                                3 -> acc to book genre

If you want to access the book name that is the first element of list access by
    data = show_one("Book Name", 1)
    print("Book Name is str(data[0][0])")

To access the author, it is the 2nd element of list
      data = show_one("Book Name", 1)
      print("Book Author is str(data[0][1])")

To access the genre is same way but it is 3rd element
    data = show_one("Book Name", 1)
    print("Book Genre is str(data[0][0])")
